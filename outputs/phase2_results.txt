Enhancements from base template:
- PCA dimensionality reduction for fractal base
- 5-level hierarchical clustering (5, 10, 20, 50, 100 clusters)
- Mixed-precision: INT8 for all dims, INT16 for important dims
- Fractal dimension calculation using box-counting
- Graph structure preservation
- Comprehensive metadata tracking
