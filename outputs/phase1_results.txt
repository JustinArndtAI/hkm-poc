Phase 1: Entanglement Process Results
=====================================
Date: 2025-09-02
Environment: Windows 11, RTX 4060 GPU, 32GB RAM

Step 1: Script Creation
-----------------------
Script: phase1_entangle.py
Created: Successfully
Modifications from base template:
- Using all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model (faster, smaller)
- Processing 500 WikiText samples (subset for PoC)
- Processing 100 FB15k relationships
- Probabilistic threshold between 0.5-0.8 for diffusion effect
- GPU acceleration enabled
- Added progress tracking with tqdm
- Saving metadata along with graph

Step 2: Entanglement Process Execution  
---------------------------------------
Runtime: 8.23 seconds (GPU accelerated)

Total nodes created: 517
Total edges created: 400
Average degree: 1.55
Connected components: 254
Largest component: 35 nodes (6.8% of graph)
Output files:
- phase1_graph.pkl: Successfully created
